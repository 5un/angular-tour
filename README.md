<tour placement="{{ tt_placement }}"

  <tour-tip 
  	title="{{ tt_title }}"
  	content="{{ tt_content }}"
  	is-open="true"
  	>
  </tour-tip>    	

tour directive should
  scroll from one step to the next
  change state of step to active
  when step is active it should create a tour-tip
  alternatively tour-tip could be the equivalent of step
  and keep track of the current position
